## Simple Web Logs

### Category:
Intro

### Challenge:
We have pulled a couple of lines from an apache web access log file for you to investigate.  It appears an attacker tried to authenticate to the server with a weird string, and then a few minutes later there was a strange request.  Is there any way you can tell me whose account they tried to authenticate against, what they tried to do against the server, and if it was successful?

## More Web Logs

### Category:
Intro

### Challenge:
We have pulled some logs from one of our wesbites for you to check.  Are you able to advise if the attacker was able to locate any sensitive files and, if so, what file, and what they used to retrieve it?

### Flag Format: flag{file_program} e.g. flag{flag.txt_Firefox}

### Attachment:
access.7z

### Steps:
1. Extract the 7zip archive
2. Grep for 200 in the log file and output to new file
(intro/mwl1.png)
3. Or grep inverse for 403/404 in log file
(intro/mwl2.png)
4. Open new file
5. Find correct line among the 200 results
(intro/mwl3.png)
6. Note that "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)" is the same user agent string for all the 400 results, indicating that this was probably not the program used to download the file, but instead a directory bruteforcer (in this case, that of *dirb*)
7. Combine filename and program as flag

### Flag:
`flag{backups_wget}`
